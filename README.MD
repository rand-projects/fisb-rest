|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FIS-B Rest is **NOT** intended for actual flight use, nor to be used as a component of a system for any flight related operations (flight planning, etc). It is strictly a fun hobby program with many bugs. It is based loosely on draft standards, not actual standards, and has not undergone any formal testing. **DO NOT USE OTHER THAN FOR FUN-- NOT FLIGHT!!** |
